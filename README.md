EcoFinds (Static DB Edition)

EcoFinds is a sustainable e-commerce web project that allows users to browse eco-friendly products, view product details, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout.

This edition has been remade to use a static database (assets/js/db.js) so that it runs entirely offline without requiring any backend or external API. The UI remains exactly the same as the original version.

Features

Static Database: All data (products, cart, users, orders) is stored in assets/js/db.js.

Browse Products: listing.html loads product data from the static DB.

Cart Management: cart.html displays cart items from the static DB.

Lightweight & Offline Ready: Works with no backend server.

Easy Customization: Just edit db.js to add/remove products.
